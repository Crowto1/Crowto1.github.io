##### Overview
This investigation focuses on the forensic analysis of a USB stick image, validated against its provided MD5 hash to ensure integrity. All actions taken during the investigation will be thoroughly documented, including accurate timestamps and the specific forensic tools used, along with their version numbers.

Contemporaneous notes will be maintained and digitally signed by the end of each day to preserve the chain of custody and support evidence admissibility. The investigation will address the questions provided by the line manager and will strictly remain within the defined scope of the case.
